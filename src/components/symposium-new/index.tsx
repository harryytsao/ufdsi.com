      description: 'This talk introduces my recent e-book with the same title, freely available on arxiv. The book uses the modern theory of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human suffering or mental pain. Both humans and sophisticated AI agents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain rewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind. The book starts with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability, and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration. Such computational theory is finally used to derive various interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans. The ensuing interventions are very similar to those proposed by Buddhist and Stoic philosophy, and include mindfulness meditation.',

      description: 'Assumptions are a necessary part of making conclusions and inferences from data. Formal training in Statistics and data science tends to encourage a mathematical and automatic treatment of assumptions, with relatively low expectations for justifying assumptions in the context of the problem or conveying the extent to which conclusions are conditional on assumptions. With so much focus on methods and computing, it is important to also take time to step back and more deeply consider the layers of assumptions that make up the foundation of any data analysis. I believe statisticians and data scientists have a responsibility to better convey the conditional nature of results, and to work with subject matter experts to translate and interrogate assumptions within a particular scientific context. While this is challenging in most problems, it is a necessary step toward better justifying the use of, and trust in, statistical results. The goal of this high-level talk is to increase, or re-highlight, awareness and spur discussion about related challenges and strategies.',

      description: 'The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.',
